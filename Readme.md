Invisible Cloak

Being a Harry Potter fan, we all have cherished the mesmerising magical fantasy world.Have you always wondered how life would be if you had the superpower of being invisible, here’s how you can experience one — obviously this is not possible in real life but can be achieved with few lines of code in OpenCV.

Algorithm:

1. Capture and store the background frame

2. Detect the red coloured cloth using colour detection and segmentation algorithm.

3. Segment out the red coloured cloth by generating a mask.

4. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect.
